To count the number of walls around, it is used the 8-neighbour model. However, if the previous condition is not followed, the probability of generating that wall, which decreases exponentially, changes dynamically with the obstacles already placed. A lot of different types of maps can be generated in a O(rows * cols) time guaranteed. |
